# Anti-流水账 rubric (Tongji bachelor thesis)

Use this rubric to evaluate or rewrite a section.

## 1) Section-level checklist
- The section opens with a clear research question/objective.
- Claims are paired with evidence (citations, data, or derivations).
- Each paragraph contains interpretation (解释), not just description.
- The section ends with a takeaway and a transition.

## 2) Preferred paragraph patterns
- Problem → Method → Result → Implication
- Claim → Evidence → Interpretation → Mini-conclusion

## 3) Common failure modes
- “We did A, then B, then C” with no evaluation metrics.
- “It is important/significant” with no justification.
- Terms drift (same concept named differently).
- Results shown without baselines/comparisons.

## 4) Output requirements
- When rewriting, keep the author’s technical meaning.
- Replace vague adjectives with measurable statements where possible.
- If evidence is missing, insert `【待补充：...】` and ask the user what data/source exists.
